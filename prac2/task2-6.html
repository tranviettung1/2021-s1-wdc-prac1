      <h1>Check out my borders</h1>

      <p>We've modified the content div to have a 1px darkgrey border with rounded corners of an 8px radius.</p>

      <p>Other elements can have borders too, <span class="red-border">like this span with the class red-border</span>.</p>

      <hr>

      <p>You can change the color of horizontal rules by changing the border color;
      <br>all horizontal rules are now #CFDFE4.
      </p>

      <p>Alternately, <span class="red-outline">this span has a red outline (red-outline class).</span>
      <br>That prevents it from messing with the line height.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>Notice how the borders double up here:</p>


        <div class="red-border">This div has a red border</div>
        <div class="blue-border">This div has a blue border</div>


      <p>Notice how this fixes the borders:</p>


        <div class="red-border-fix">This div has a red border, except on the bottom, and 8px round top corners</div>
        <div class="blue-border-fix">This div has a blue border, and 8px round bottom corners</div>

    </div>
